# Pro-Wordle
This was a project for a computer science course that aims to teaching basics of the 3 main programming paradigms.
This project was a direct application to the concepts of declarative programming using the language Prolog. We used
the basics of the language such as recursion and data structures to create this simple game. The project is an 
immitation of the famous game "Wordle!". So it follows the same rules as the actual game; you choose a category, then you get
a number of guesses, you keep on guessing till you reach the guess limit and lose or get the correct word and win. The game
is to be played in the prolog console. We were a team of 3 in this project and below you can find the contacts of my group.
